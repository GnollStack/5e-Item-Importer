# Strict Spell Item authoring reference

## Destination and prerequisites

Paste the complete document into Item Importer. Begin with `SCHEMA_VERSION: 2` and the `SPELL` root.

Item Importer alone supports core fields. Activity/effect attachments require the optional Activity Importer; use its matching templates. Free/core is the default when companion availability is unknown. Loot/Container accept passive effects only.

Read the [generation guide](../README.md) and [authoring rules and validation](../../docs/template-authoring.md) with this file. Explicit field contracts target D&D5e 5.3.3 / Foundry 14.367; MIDI annotations, when used, target MIDI-QOL 14.0.9. Package versions and YAML versions are separate.

## Generate or preserve

**Create from a description:** include fields needed for the stated mechanics and any explicitly supplied settings. Omit unrelated optional sections. Do not populate every placeholder or copy example bonuses into a different item. Ask for missing information that changes the mechanics or a required reference; use a documented default only when it does not change the source intent. Invent mechanics only when the user explicitly requests homebrew design.

**Preserve supplied data:** retain every supported supplied value, including stored inactive settings, false, zero, empty collections and documented nulls. Keep the controlling toggle independent. Unsupported values remain a reported limitation; do not silently replace them with a guess.

**Final output:** one YAML code block, with two-space indentation and a space after each colon. Replace every bracket placeholder and remove template comments. Preserve formulas as quoted strings and descriptions as HTML or plain text. Use native YAML booleans and numbers. Do not add prompt-mode, compatibility-report or licensing keys to YAML. If a required fact is missing, ask before producing final importable YAML.

## Reading the reference

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Required | Needed for valid input at the indicated location. |
| Conditionally required | Needed when the stated choice or intended mechanic requires it; distinguish parser rejection from runtime prerequisites. |
| Optional | May be omitted in newly authored input when no value is supplied. |
| Context-dependent | Needs a parent Item, actor, accessible document, registry or workflow context. |
| Compatibility input | An accepted older spelling/representation; use the canonical spelling for new YAML. |

The first YAML block is a **complete field reference**, not a ready-made item to import unchanged. Placeholders describe choices, not default values. Later examples contain concrete values.

Missing, `null`, `false`, `0`, `""`, `[]` and `{}` are distinct. Use `n/a` only for fields that document it as an unset marker. Never use it as a universal substitute for null or empty data. `CHANGES.Value` retains its YAML type, including the literal text `n/a`. Formula syntax acceptance does not establish that referenced variables exist.

For new physical Items, ordinary defaults are quantity 1, identified true, equipped false and zero unspecified price/weight. Omit unsupplied rarity, attunement restrictions and optional resources rather than inventing them. Formula Uses Max must be deterministic, one line and at most 200 characters, without dice or semicolons; recovery needs a positive literal maximum or a formula maximum.

## Configuration rules

This is a native Spell Item, not a physical inventory item: rarity, quantity, price, weight and unidentified-description fields are not current spell authoring controls. Use Prepared:unprepared/prepared/always for native 0/1/2 state. COMPONENTS.Ritual is independent of Method; use Method:spell for an ordinary ritual-capable prepared spell. Preserve material cost/supply, consumed state and inactive components independently. Source-specific attacks, saves, healing and effects require companion attachments in full output.


## Concrete example

A free/core spell import. Preserve the complete description; it does not automatically create source-specific activities or effects.

5e Item Importer. Activity Importer is not required for this example.

The [standalone YAML file](../../docs/examples/core-spell.yaml) matches this block. See [example prerequisites and validation](../../docs/examples/README.md). Examples establish the stated stored data and validation scope; they do not certify every gameplay combination.

## Compatibility and support

Use canonical keys in new YAML. Legacy aliases in the reference tables are compatibility input; never combine conflicting aliases with canonical fields. Native schema choices, sheet choices and importer coverage can differ. Unknown fields are not generic YAML extension points.

Full Item export needs companion serializers for its attachments; unsupported attachments can block full export. Keep source rules in descriptions for manual mechanics.

## Detailed field and text reference

## OPTIONAL ACTIVITIES AND ACTIVE EFFECTS

The core Item fields and description import without `5e-activity-importer`. Description enrichers create clickable text; they do not construct attack, saving throw, damage, healing, or condition activities. The importer does not generate those mechanics from strict YAML description text. Some item types receive generic system defaults, which do not reproduce arbitrary source rules.

For a functional item with source-defined rolls or effects, include the appropriate `Activities` and/or `effects` entries when Activity Importer is available for this workflow or the user requests its support. This includes a spell's primary save and damage, not only extra actions. Use the matching complete Activity Importer templates from `modules/5e-activity-importer/templates/Base Activity Templates/`, or the MIDI variants when that automation is intended. Preserve source mechanics, triggers, costs, and scaling; never invent mechanics, UUIDs, macros, or module-specific effect keys. If a rule cannot be represented, retain it in the description for manual resolution.

In free/core mode, or when companion support is unavailable or unspecified, omit these sections and preserve the full rules in the description. The resulting import does not promise automated use of those rules. Do not add empty placeholder entries. Both sections require the companion module to be active at import time, and the selected dnd5e Item type must support the requested activities.

Append supported sections at the same indentation as `DESCRIPTION` and `CHAT_FLAVOR`, beneath the Item type key:
- `Activities` is an array. Each entry contains exactly one `ACTIVITY_*` key and the corresponding activity body. Multiple activities of the same type are separate array entries; do not insert `---` inside this array.
- `effects` is an array of effect bodies beginning with `DETAILS`, without an `EFFECT:` wrapper. Use these for passive item effects. Effects applied by an activity belong in that activity's `APPLIED_EFFECTS` array instead; do not duplicate them here.
- For effects on Foundry 14, use DURATION.Value and DURATION.Units; units may be years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, rounds, or turns. Use a nonnegative integer Value, or null for no finite duration.

Use canonical string `Change Type` and a status list. Preserve the YAML type of each `CHANGES[].Value`: a number, boolean, string, list, mapping, or null must match the intended change. Do not quote everything. Legacy numeric `Change Mode` and separate duration labels remain accepted input. Optional Activity ID and Effect ID values must contain exactly 16 alphanumeric characters; omit them when stable references are unnecessary.

The completed examples below demonstrate array nesting for a passive +1 AC ward and an action that deals 1d6 fire damage. They are illustrative only: include them only if the source actually grants those mechanics, and use the full matching companion template for the requested activity type.

```yaml
  effects:

## **FIELD REFERENCE**

### **Spellcasting Ability Override**
Use `Ability` in the `ITEM` section to override the class spellcasting ability for this specific spell. Useful for racial or feat-granted spells that use a fixed ability (e.g., `cha` for Tiefling spells, `int` for Eldritch Knight spells). Set to `n/a` to use the class default.

| Value | Ability |
|-------|---------|
| `str` | Strength |
| `dex` | Dexterity |
| `con` | Constitution |
| `int` | Intelligence |
| `wis` | Wisdom |
| `cha` | Charisma |
| `n/a` | Use class default |

---

### **Spell Schools**
| Key | School |
|-----|--------|
| `abj` | Abjuration |
| `con` | Conjuration |
| `div` | Divination |
| `enc` | Enchantment |
| `evo` | Evocation |
| `ill` | Illusion |
| `nec` | Necromancy |
| `trs` | Transmutation |

### **Preparation Methods**
| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `atwill` | At Will (always available, no slot needed) |
| `innate` | Innate (uses per day, not spell slots) |
| `ritual` | Legacy ritual-only preparation (always prepared); when Components Ritual is omitted, also enables the ritual property. |
| `pact` | Pact Magic (Warlock slot) |
| `spell` | Standard spellbook/prepared spell |

Legacy `prepared` is still accepted for backward compatibility, but new templates should use `spell`.

### **Ritual Casting and Materials**

| Field | Description | Accepted Values |
|---|---|---|
| `COMPONENTS.Ritual` | Whether this spell can be cast as a ritual, independently of preparation. A normal ritual-capable spell uses `Ritual: true` with `PREPARATION.Method: spell`. | `true` or `false`; default `false`. |
| `MATERIALS.Cost` | Material component cost in gold pieces. | Finite nonnegative number (integer or decimal); `0` when no cost is stated. |
| `MATERIALS.Supply` | Tracked supply of material components. | Finite nonnegative number (integer or decimal); `0` when no supply is tracked. |

New YAML must state `COMPONENTS.Ritual` explicitly. An explicit boolean takes precedence over the legacy `Method: ritual` implication. Older YAML with an omitted, null, or `n/a` Ritual field retains that legacy inference.

### **Activation Types**
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `action` | Action |
| `bonus` | Bonus Action |
| `reaction` | Reaction |
| `minute` | Minutes (use Value for count) |
| `hour` | Hours (use Value for count) |
| `day` | Days |
| `special` | Special |

### **Range Units**
| Unit | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `self` | Self (no range value needed) |
| `touch` | Touch |
| `spec` | Special |
| `any` | Unlimited / Any distance |
| `ft` | Feet |
| `mi` | Miles |
| `m` | Meters |
| `km` | Kilometers |

### **Duration Units**
| Unit | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `inst` | Instantaneous |
| `spec` | Special |
| `turn` | Turn |
| `round` | Rounds |
| `minute` | Minutes |
| `hour` | Hours |
| `day` | Days |
| `month` | Months |
| `year` | Years |
| `disp` | Until dispelled |
| `dstr` | Until dispelled or triggered |
| `perm` | Permanent |

### **Target Types**
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `self` | Self |
| `ally` | Ally |
| `enemy` | Enemy |
| `creature` | Any creature |
| `object` | Object |
| `space` | Space/point |
| `creatureOrObject` | Creature or Object |
| `any` | Any target |
| `willing` | Willing creature |

### **Area Shapes**
| Shape | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `cone` | Cone |
| `cube` | Cube |
| `cylinder` | Cylinder |
| `radius` | Radius/burst |
| `line` | Line |
| `sphere` | Sphere |
| `circle` | Circle |
| `square` | Square |
| `wall` | Wall |

### **Area Advanced Fields**
| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `Count` | Number of separate template areas | *Conjure Animals* (multiple zones) |
| `Width` | Width of the area (for line/wall shapes) | *Wall of Fire* width |
| `Height` | Height of the area (for cylinder/wall shapes) | *Cloudkill* height |
| `Contiguous` | Whether multiple templates must be adjacent | `true` or `false` |

These fields are optional and only needed for spells with unusual area geometry. Most spells only need `Shape`, `Size`, and `Units`.

### **Recovery Periods**
| Period | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `lr` | Long Rest |
| `sr` | Short Rest |
| `day` | Daily (any time) |
| `dawn` | At dawn |
| `dusk` | At dusk |
| `recharge` | Recharge threshold: set Formula to 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 |

### **Recovery Types**
| Type | Formula | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| `recoverAll` | n/a | Regain all uses |
| `loseAll` | n/a | Lose all remaining uses |
| `formula` | Dice (e.g., `1d4+1`) | Regain rolled amount |
| `formula` | Number (e.g., `5`) | For recharge: regain all on d6 ≥ 5 |

## Explicit fields in Item YAML schema 2

Verification target: D&D5e 5.3.3 / Foundry 14.367. Item YAML versions 0 and 1 remain accepted in memory. Complete field mappings, conditions, defaults, exclusions, and tests are recorded in [the field coverage reference](../../docs/explicit-yaml-v2.md).

| Field | Stored value / default |
|---|---|
| ITEM.Icon | Native image path. A supplied path takes priority over automatic icon selection. |
| ITEM.Identifier / ITEM.Sort | Native identifier / integer ordering value; zero is valid. |
| SOURCE.Book, Page, Custom, License, Rules, Revision | Native source information. Revision is numeric (default 1); page is text. |
| ATTUNEMENT.Attuned | Current item state, separate from the attunement requirement. Applies to equippable types, including Container. Default false. |
| Formula fields | Preserve the complete formula string. Numeric fields reject expressions and fractional values when the native field requires integers. |
| Inactive controls | Retain supplied values without enabling the controlling property or override. Omit a conditional section only when no stored settings need preservation. |

DAMAGE_DATA is the canonical damage representation for Weapon base/versatile damage and Consumable damage. It preserves Dice Count, Die Denomination, Bonus, the Damage Types list, Custom Enabled, Custom Formula, Scaling Mode, Scaling Dice Count, and Scaling Formula. Dice values are nonnegative integers or null; formulas are strings; Custom Enabled defaults false; Scaling Mode defaults none. An inactive custom formula and inactive structured damage remain stored together. Do not combine populated legacy damage shorthand with DAMAGE_DATA. Legacy formula/type labels remain accepted on input. Consumable DAMAGE.Replace defaults false; old ammunition Damage Replace remains an alias.

Additional controls apply by item type: Tool PROPERTIES.Focus; Loot ITEM.Loot Subtype; siege/vehicle Crew Capacity, Speed, Speed Units, and Speed Conditions. Weapon reach and ranges accept native decimals. RELOAD.Reload Amount is private metadata in flags.5e-item-importer.reloadAmount, with no native reload automation.

Spell PREPARATION.Prepared exports unprepared/prepared/always and accepts native 0/1/2 or legacy booleans. Source Item stores the spellcasting source identifier. RANGE.Special, DURATION.Special, and AREA.Stationary retain their native values. Range, duration, target count, and every area dimension/count accept formulas. Material settings remain stored when Material is false.
