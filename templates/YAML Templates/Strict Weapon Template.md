# Strict_Weapon_Template_v3.md

## INSTRUCTIONS

**Free and premium generation modes:**
- 5e Activity Importer is a forthcoming premium companion, not included with this free release. Use free/core output unless premium output is explicitly requested or companion availability is confirmed.
- **Free/core (default):** 5e Item Importer is free and works alone. Generate core Item fields and the complete source rules in descriptions. Omit `Activities` and `effects` entirely; description enrichers do not create those mechanics.
- **Premium/full:** Use this mode only when the user explicitly requests it or confirms that 5e Activity Importer is available. Add only source-defined, supported activities/effects using that premium companion's strict templates. Keep the complete rules in the Item description as well. Activity Importer must be active when importing attachments.
- If module availability is unspecified, use free/core mode. Merely receiving this template does not establish premium availability. An explicit free/core request takes precedence even when both modules are installed.
- These mode names are prompt instructions, not YAML fields. Do not emit mode, edition, purchase, or licensing metadata.
- Loot and Container support passive `effects` only; never emit `Activities` for those types.

**How to use this template:**
- Output every field shown in required sections. Use `n/a` for required scalar fields that do not apply.
- Begin every YAML document with `SCHEMA_VERSION: 1` before the Item type key.
- Wrap the completed YAML in a single ```` ```yaml ```` code fence.
- Omit entire conditional sections when their condition is not met. Do not output a conditional section filled with `n/a`.
- For DESCRIPTION fields, use HTML with Foundry VTT Enrichers (see reference at the bottom of this template).

**dnd5e Description Features:**
- `DESCRIPTION.Description` and `CHAT_FLAVOR.Chat Description` preserve Foundry/dnd5e text features for Foundry to resolve when displayed.
- You can use dnd5e enrichers such as `[[/damage 1d6 fire average]]`, roll-data formulas such as `@prof` or `@abilities.str.mod`, dynamic lookups such as `[[lookup @name]]{the creature}`, System HTML classes, and pass-through document links such as `@UUID[...]` or `@Embed[...]`.
- Use stock dnd5e `[[lookup @name]]` text for active narration and chat flavor: sentence start `[[lookup @name]]{The creature} drinks the potion.`; mid-sentence `When [[lookup @name]]{the creature} hits with this weapon...`. This normally resolves to the actor name; the optional Token Name Lookup companion can prefer token aliases at render time without changing item syntax.
- Keep passive rules text natural. Do not force dynamic name lookups into every description.

**Batching multiple items:**
Combine different item types in one block by stacking top-level keys:
```text
SCHEMA_VERSION: 1
WEAPON:
  ITEM:
    Name: "Longsword +1"
    # additional fields omitted in this batching example
EQUIPMENT:
  ITEM:
    Name: "Plate Armor +1"
    # additional fields omitted in this batching example
```
For multiple items of the **same type**, separate them with `---` (YAML document separator):
```text
SCHEMA_VERSION: 1
WEAPON:
  ITEM:
    Name: "Longsword +1"
    # additional fields omitted in this batching example
---
SCHEMA_VERSION: 1
WEAPON:
  ITEM:
    Name: "Dagger of Venom"
    # additional fields omitted in this batching example
```
You can mix both methods. Supported top-level keys: `SPELL`, `WEAPON`, `EQUIPMENT`, `CONSUMABLE`, `TOOL`, `LOOT`, `CONTAINER`.

**For LLM generation:**
- Output ONLY the yaml code block. No commentary before or after.
- Use exact values from the FIELD REFERENCE tables at the bottom of this document. Do not invent values.
- Booleans: `true` or `false` (lowercase, no quotes).
- Required scalar fields that do not apply: use the literal string `n/a`.
- **Omit conditional sections entirely** (e.g., ATTUNEMENT, AMMUNITION, RELOAD) when their condition is not met. Do not fill omitted sections with `n/a` values.
- For functional source-defined mechanics, use the companion Activities/Active Effects workflow below in premium/full mode. For a core Item import without companion support, omit both sections and retain the rules in the description.
- Do not include template comments (`# ...`) in the final YAML output.
- Do not omit individual fields from required sections just because their value is `n/a`.
- Replace every bracketed placeholder value; never output literal placeholders like `[text]` or `[integer]`.
- Use HTML tags inside description fields, not Markdown headings or Markdown lists.
- For mixed weapon damage formulas like `1d8[piercing] + 1d6[lightning]`, set `Damage Type` to the weapon's primary damage type, such as `piercing`. Do the same for `Versatile Damage Type`. The primary type gives dnd5e a default for system-added ability and magic bonuses, while bracketed formula terms keep extra damage such as lightning separate for resistance and immunity.
- Use `n/a` for `Damage Type` or `Versatile Damage Type` only when the typed formula is fully self-contained and will not receive system-added ability, magic, or ammunition bonuses.

**YAML Syntax Rules (do not violate):**
- Every key needs a SPACE after the colon: `KEY: value`, never `KEY:value`. js-yaml will reject the file with a confusing "multiline key" error otherwise.
- Empty arrays are written `KEY: []` and empty mappings `KEY: {}` — both with the space.
- Indentation is exactly 2 spaces per level. No tabs. No 4-space jumps.

**Default assumptions when source text is silent:**
- Quantity: `1`
- Identified: `true`
- Equipped: `false`
- Rarity: `n/a` for mundane or unspecified items.
- Price Value: `0`; Price Denomination: `gp`
- Weight Value: `0` when negligible or not listed; Weight Units: `lb`
- Uses Spent: `0`; Uses Max: `n/a` unless the item tracks charges or uses.
- RECOVERY: `[]` when no charge recovery applies.
- Unidentified Name: `n/a`; Unidentified Description: `n/a` unless an unidentified version is needed.
- Chat Description: `n/a` unless special chat flavor is needed.

## OPTIONAL ACTIVITIES AND ACTIVE EFFECTS

The core Item fields and description import without `5e-activity-importer`. Description enrichers create clickable text; they do not construct attack, saving throw, damage, healing, or condition activities. The importer does not generate those mechanics from strict YAML description text. Some item types receive generic system defaults, which do not reproduce arbitrary source rules.

For a functional item with source-defined rolls or effects, include the appropriate `Activities` and/or `effects` entries when Activity Importer is available for this workflow or the user requests its support. This includes a spell's primary save and damage, not only extra actions. Use the matching complete Activity Importer templates from `modules/5e-activity-importer/templates/Base Activity Templates/`, or the MIDI variants when that automation is intended. Preserve source mechanics, triggers, costs, and scaling; never invent mechanics, UUIDs, macros, or module-specific effect keys. If a rule cannot be represented, retain it in the description for manual resolution.

In free/core mode, or when companion support is unavailable or unspecified, omit these sections and preserve the full rules in the description. The resulting import does not promise automated use of those rules. Do not add empty placeholder entries. Both sections require the companion module to be active at import time, and the selected dnd5e Item type must support the requested activities.

Append supported sections at the same indentation as `DESCRIPTION` and `CHAT_FLAVOR`, beneath the Item type key:
- `Activities` is an array. Each entry contains exactly one `ACTIVITY_*` key and the corresponding activity body. Multiple activities of the same type are separate array entries; do not insert `---` inside this array.
- `effects` is an array of effect bodies beginning with `DETAILS`, without an `EFFECT:` wrapper. Use these for passive item effects. Effects applied by an activity belong in that activity's `APPLIED_EFFECTS` array instead; do not duplicate them here.
- For each effect on Foundry 14, populate at most one duration unit (Seconds, Rounds, or Turns), using `n/a` for the other units.

The completed examples below demonstrate array nesting for a passive +1 AC ward and an action that deals 1d6 fire damage. They are illustrative only: include them only if the source actually grants those mechanics, and use the full matching companion template for the requested activity type.

```yaml
  effects:
    - DETAILS:
        Name: "Armor Ward"
        Icon Tint Color: n/a
        Effect Suspended: false
