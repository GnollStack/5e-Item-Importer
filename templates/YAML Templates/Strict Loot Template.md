# Strict_Loot_Template_v3.md

## INSTRUCTIONS

**How to use this template:**
- Fill in every field. Use `n/a` for fields that don't apply.
- Wrap the completed YAML in a single ```` ```yaml ```` code fence.
- Conditional sections (marked with `#` comments) can be omitted entirely when not applicable.
- For DESCRIPTION fields, use HTML with Foundry VTT Enrichers (see reference at the bottom of this template).

**Batching multiple items:**
Combine different item types in one block by stacking top-level keys:
```yaml
LOOT:
  ITEM:
    Name: "Ruby Gemstone"
    ...
WEAPON:
  ITEM:
    Name: "Longsword +1"
    ...
```
For multiple items of the **same type**, separate them with `---` (YAML document separator):
```yaml
LOOT:
  ITEM:
    Name: "Ruby Gemstone"
    ...
---
LOOT:
  ITEM:
    Name: "Gold Idol"
    ...
```
You can mix both methods. Supported top-level keys: `SPELL`, `WEAPON`, `EQUIPMENT`, `CONSUMABLE`, `TOOL`, `LOOT`, `CONTAINER`.

**For LLM generation:**
- Output ONLY the yaml code block. No commentary before or after.
- Use exact values from the FIELD REFERENCE tables at the bottom of this document. Do not invent values.
- Booleans: `true` or `false` (lowercase, no quotes).
- Inapplicable scalar fields: use the literal string `n/a`.
- **Omit both `effects:` and `Activities:` entirely** unless explicitly requested.
