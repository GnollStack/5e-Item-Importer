# Strict_Container_Template_v3.md

## INSTRUCTIONS

**How to use this template:**
- Fill in every field. Use `n/a` for fields that don't apply.
- Wrap the completed YAML in a single ```` ```yaml ```` code fence.
- Conditional sections (marked with `#` comments) can be omitted entirely when not applicable.
- For DESCRIPTION fields, use HTML with Foundry VTT Enrichers (see reference at the bottom of this template).

**Batching multiple items:**
Combine different item types in one block by stacking top-level keys:
```yaml
CONTAINER:
  ITEM:
    Name: "Bag of Holding"
    ...
WEAPON:
  ITEM:
    Name: "Longsword +1"
    ...
```
For multiple items of the **same type**, separate them with `---` (YAML document separator):
```yaml
CONTAINER:
  ITEM:
    Name: "Bag of Holding"
    ...
---
CONTAINER:
  ITEM:
    Name: "Handy Haversack"
    ...
```
You can mix both methods. Supported top-level keys: `WEAPON`, `EQUIPMENT`, `CONSUMABLE`, `TOOL`, `LOOT`, `CONTAINER`.

**For LLM generation:**
- Output ONLY the yaml code block. No commentary before or after.
- Use exact values from the FIELD REFERENCE tables at the bottom of this document. Do not invent values.
- Booleans: `true` or `false` (lowercase, no quotes).
- Inapplicable fields: use the literal string `n/a`.
- **Omit the `Activities` section entirely** unless the user explicitly requests activities.

## **HTML PATTERNS**

### **Standard Container Description**
```html
<p><em>A brief flavor description of the container's appearance.</em></p>
<hr>

<p>This container can hold up to X pounds of material, not exceeding Y cubic feet in volume.</p>
```

### **Extradimensional Space Warning**
```html
<p><strong>Extradimensional Interference.</strong> Placing this container inside an extradimensional space created by a &Reference[Bag of Holding], &Reference[Portable Hole], or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane.</p>
```

### **Retrieval Mechanics**
```html
<p><strong>Retrieval.</strong> Retrieving an item from the container requires an action. If a specific item is desired, you can find it instantly without searching.</p>
```

### **Hazard/Trap Pattern**
```html
<p><strong>Triggered Trap.</strong> When opened by a creature not attuned to it, the container releases a burst of energy. Each creature within 10 feet must make a [[/save dex 14 format=long]] or take [[/damage 3d6 fire average]].</p>
```

### **Cursed Container Pattern**
```html
<p><strong>Curse.</strong> Once you place an item inside this container, you must succeed on a [[/save wis 15 format=long]] or become unwilling to part with it. While cursed, you have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks whenever the container is more than 10 feet away from you.</p>
```
